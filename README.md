In a world of unstable traditional currencies, Cardano shines as a guiding light, bringing together those without access to banking. Its blockchain technology conducts a harmonious financial system, giving people secure identities and digital wallets. Breaking free from the exclusion of the system to take part in the economy.

Do we use $ARS "Oracle" to get the pair ARS/ADA [criptoya api](https://criptoya.com/api) using Binance P2P Value</br>
